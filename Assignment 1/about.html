    <h1>About Page</h1>

    <h4>1. What special features have you done, or attempted, in creating the 
        site that we should know about?
    </h4>
    <p>- I've put an image to indicate when the posting is succeeded or failed. Also I'm using bootstrap and CSS file to stylise the website </p></br>


    <h4>2. Which parts did you have trouble with?</h4>
    <p>- I had few issues with php methods and saving/pulling data from database. 
        I was not familiar with using php method as it was my first time using it properly. Also when I am doing 
        debugging it was difficult to track the code in php. 
    </p></br>


    <h4>3. What would you like to do better next time?</h4>
    <p>- Adding style within short period of time required lots of efforts and concentration. If I had a chance to create another website, 
        I would like to spend more time on styling.</p></br>


    <h4>4. What referenced/sources you have used to help you learn how
        to create your website?
    </h4>
    <p>- Mostly I looked lecture note but also had reaserch on website such
        as w3school.com to hava a look at the example codes, also getbootstrap.com to find out what styling options they provide.
    </p></br>


    <h4>5. What you have learn along the way?</h4>
    <p>- I learnt how the entire website is working. Website can be divided into to two parts; backend and frontend. To communicate in between backend and frontend, php methods was compulsory.
        Connection string also allows to communicate with database.
